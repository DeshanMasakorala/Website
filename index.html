            <p> Sri Lanka's history spans over 3,000 years, with evidence of human settlement dating back approximately <u>125,000 years</u> The island has been shaped significantly by the Indian subcontinent, particularly through the arrival of Buddhism around 250 BCE, which became the predominant religion among the Sinhalese majority. The establishment of kingdoms such as Anuradhapura <i>(377 BCE â€“ 1017 CE)</i> marked significant political and cultural developments. The island experienced various foreign influences, notably from European powers like the Portuguese, Dutch, and British from the 16th century onwards. This colonial period saw changes in governance and economic structures, leading to social tensions that culminated in a civil war from 1983 to 2009 between the Sinhalese majority and Tamil separatists</p>
